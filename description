I used c language to programme because i am familiar with it since first semster and I learned data structures in c language so i fel comfortable and used c to code.

prims algorithm assumes all vertices are connected but in the given graph all vertices are not so it wont work for given graph

kruskals algorithm fails to detect cycles in the directed graph so it wont work for the given directed graph

dijkstras algorithm expects all weights to be non negative where as in the given graph one of the weights is negative so it wont work for the given graph

since all three are failed to solve this graph. bellman-ford is best algorithm to solve this problem but its a slower algorithm.
